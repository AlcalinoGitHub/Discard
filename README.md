# Discard

## About
This repo is an attempt to build a functional 'clon' of discord \
Feel free to use my code on your own project  *(I may be garbage at coding, but at least its open source)*

## Includes or will include
-One to One chats\
-Servers\
-Channels\
-Admin pannel (limited functionality, more like that of whatsapp)\
-Blocking users and servers (probably will be only client side checks)\

## Will most likely not include
-Advanced server configuration (for example: roles, member specific channels)\
-Audio or video calls (unless theres a public and free to use API for it, which I doubt)\

## May include in a future
-Profile customization (mainly username and pfp)\
-Server customization (server picture)\
-Channel customization (Addinc a desc)\

## For developers
